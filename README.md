# Sistema de soporte Diagnostico ECG
This work presents a system to support the diagnosis of normal and pathological pulses in ECG recordings, capable of analyzing the characteristics of QRS complexes that greatly help to classify cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, this research uses the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database, which has 48 records of different arrhythmias. Likewise, supervised machine learning algorithms and appropriate feature selection are implemented to generate a low computational cost computer system, which allows processing, characterization, classification and visualization of the results. Given its relevance in the clinical setting, its performance is validated using performance measures recommended by the literature.

MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database - PhysioBank ATM: (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)

The dataset selected for this study corresponds to the MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database. The database contains two-channel ambulatory ECG records from 47 individuals analyzed by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. Forty-eight half-hour recordings were collected using analog Holter equipment with a sampling rate of 360 Hz and 11-bit resolution over a range of 10 mV. The database includes about 110.000 records, with five classes of arrhythmias: Nonectopic beats (N), Fusion beats (F), Supraventricular ectopic beats (S), Ventricular ectopic beats (V), and Unknown beats (U). Cardiologists performed the classification and annotation of the recordings of each heartbeat. 


# List and specification of files
1) Folder (File Models)
In this folder you will find four files with extension (.mat). The files with the name (classification_model_classifier) are the training models generated by our machine learning classifiers. The file with the name (features_remove_Savitzky_Golay_extraction_DWT) is the set of features extracted from all ECG records previously labeled with each arrhythmia class.

2) Folder (Generate_Learning_model)
In this folder you will find the files responsible for generating all the models found in the folder (File Models). On the one hand, you will find a folder containing all the records of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database with extension (.csv) together with their annotations (.txt).
On the other hand, you will find three files (.m), of which the file (Load_Preprocess_Segment_Dataset) is responsible for loading all the database records as well as preprocessing and segmenting the signals. The file (ExtractFeatures_Dataset) is in charge of extracting all the features from the signal segments and finally the file (Training_Evaluation_Classifiers) is in charge of training the feature set using classifiers such as KNN, neural networks and decision trees. In the same way, it is also in charge of evaluating which classifier offers the best performance by applying some metrics recommended by the literature.
